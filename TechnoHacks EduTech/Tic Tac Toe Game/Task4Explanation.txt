Step 1: Initialize the Game Board
We'll start by creating the game board, which is typically a 3x3 grid. We can use a list of lists to represent the board. Initialize it with empty spaces.
Step 2: Player Input
Create a function to get input from the players. In this example, players will input their moves in the format "row, column."
Step 3: Check for a Win
We need a function to check if a player has won the game. We'll check rows, columns, and diagonals for matching symbols.
Step 4: Play the Game
Now, let's put it all together in a game loop.
