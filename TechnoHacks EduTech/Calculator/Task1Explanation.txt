Explanation:

1.We start by defining four functions, one for each basic arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2.The add(x, y), subtract(x, y), multiply(x, y), and divide(x, y) functions take two input numbers, x and y, and return the result of the corresponding operation.

3.We use a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input and perform calculations.

4.Inside the loop, we display a menu of options to the user and take their choice as input.

5.Based on the user's choice, we take two numbers as input for the chosen operation.

6.We then check the user's choice and call the appropriate function (add, subtract, multiply, or divide) to perform the calculation.

7.The result of the calculation is displayed to the user.

8.If the user enters "quit," the program exits the loop and ends.

9.If the user enters an invalid choice, they are informed of the invalid input.

10.Finally, we print a message to indicate that the calculator program has ended.
