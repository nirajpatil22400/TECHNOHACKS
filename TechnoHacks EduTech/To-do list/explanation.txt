1. Import necessary modules:import os
2. Define the filename for the to-do list:todo_file = "todo_list.txt" This line sets the filename for your to-do list. It's named "todo_list.txt."
3. Check if the to-do list file exists; if not, create it:

   if not os.path.exists(todo_file):
    with open(todo_file, "w"):
        pass

    # These lines check if the file specified in todo_file exists. If it doesn't exist, it creates an empty 
    file  using the "w" (write) mode. This ensures that your to-do list file is ready for use.

4. Function to add a task to the to-do list:

   def add_task(task):
    with open(todo_file, "a") as file:
        file.write(task + "\n")

    # This function takes a task as input and appends it to the end of the to-do list file. Each task is written on a new line.

5. Function to view the entire to-do list:

   def view_tasks():
    with open(todo_file, "r") as file:
        tasks = file.readlines()
        if not tasks:
            print("The to-do list is empty. Add your tasks using option 1.")
        else:
            for i, task in enumerate(tasks, start=1):
                print(f"{i}. {task.strip()}")

    This function reads the to-do list file and prints the tasks. If the file is empty, it displays a message indicating that the list is empty.

6. Function to delete a task:

   def delete_task(task_number):
    tasks = []
    with open(todo_file, "r") as file:
        tasks = file.readlines()

    if 1 <= task_number <= len(tasks):
        deleted_task = tasks.pop(task_number - 1)

        with open(todo_file, "w") as file:
            file.writelines(tasks)

        print(f"Deleted task: {deleted_task.strip()}")

    # This function deletes a task from the to-do list by reading the file, removing the specified task, and then writing the updated list back to the file.

7. Function to update a task:

   def update_task(task_number):
    new_task = input("Enter the updated task: ")

    tasks = []
    with open(todo_file, "r") as file:
        tasks = file.readlines()

    if 1 <= task_number <= len(tasks):
        tasks[task_number - 1] = new_task + "\n"

        with open(todo_file, "w") as file:
            file.writelines(tasks)

        print("Task updated successfully!")

    This function updates a task by reading the file, modifying the specified task, and then writing the updated list back to the file.

8. Main program loop:

    # This is where the program starts running, and it provides a menu for the user to interact with the to-do list.
    # The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.

# I've explained each part of the code in detail so you can understand how the to-do list manager works.
